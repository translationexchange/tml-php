Installation
==================

Tml for PHP can be installed using the composer dependency manager. If you don't already have composer installed on your system, you can get it using the following command:

```sh
$ cd YOUR_APPLICATION_FOLDER
$ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Create composer.json in the root folder of your application, and add the following content:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "translationexchange/tml": "3.2.18"
    }
}
```

This tells composer that your application requires tml library to be installed.

Now install Tml library by executing the following command:

```sh
$ composer install
```

Composer will automatically create a vendor folder and put the SDK into vendor/translationexchange/tml directory.

Now you are ready to integrate TML into your application.


Integration
==================

Before you can proceed with the integration, please visit http://translationexchange.com to register your application.

Once you have created a new application, you will be given an application key and a secret. You will need to enter them in the initialization function of the TML SDK.

To make sure you have installed everything correctly, create a sample test file in the root folder of your app and call it index.php

Paste the following content into the file:

```php
<?php require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/translationexchange/tml/src/init.php'); ?>
<?php tml_init(array(
    "key" => YOUR_APPLICATION_TOKEN
)); ?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="<?php echo tml_current_locale(); ?>">
<head>
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8" />
    <?php tml_scripts(); ?>
</head>
<body>
    <?php tre("Hello World") ?>
</body>
</html>
<?php tml_complete_request() ?>
```


Make sure you replace YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY with the key and YOUR_APPLICATION_TOKEN with the token you copied from translationexchange.com

You can start the default PHP web server from your application folder using the following command:

```sh
$ php -S localhost:8080
```

Now you can open up your browser and navigate to the file:

http://localhost:8080/index.php


If everything was configured correctly, you should see a phrase "Hello World" on your page.

You should see a lightbox with TML's default shortcuts. To close the lightbox, click on the top-right corner or simply press the Esc button.

Press Ctrl+Shift+L to switch to a different language.

Now you can press Ctrl+Shift+I to enable inline translations.

When inline translations are enabled you will see translated phrases underlined in green color and not translated phrases with red.

Right-Mouse-Click (or Ctrl+Click on Mac) on any phrase and you will see an inline translator window that will allow you to translate the phrase.
